# Blockchain-Health-Insurance-Fraud

This initiative leverages **blockchain technology** to prevent health insurance fraud and empower patients. Our system places personal data control back in the hands of the patients, 
promoting data security and privacy. By enabling patients to manage their own health data, we facilitate more efficient information exchanges between healthcare providers, 
insurance companies, and patients themselves. This not only simplifies the process but also reduces the potential for fraudulent activities. The project aims to revolutionize the health insurance 
landscape by making data handling more transparent, secure, and user-centric, ultimately leading to better healthcare services and outcomes.
